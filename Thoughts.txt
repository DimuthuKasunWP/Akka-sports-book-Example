 [Misc]
 * Patterns, Better best practices?
 * Annotation for methods that should be "actor" calls, or not "actor" calls?!
   - Solution, use interfaces!
 * What is the best way of implementing request/reply without using a blocking method?
 * I need to lookup stuff in redis, should i Implement the lookup with lucene?
 
 [Lessons learned]
 
 * Keep timeout LOW during development. You might call blocking methods without thinking about it.
 * Do not call internal non private methods if you are not using the interface when creating the actor
 * If you need to call public methods from within a class, create a private doSomething() method
   that you delegate to from the public method. Only applicable if you are not creating your actor
   with an interface.
 * Perhaps TO transparent, think JMS (or Akka) not normal java development. 
 * Difficult to use subclassing since we must have protected methods which are proxied
   - Aha, this can be solved by supplying an interface so only those methods are Actorified
   - May be a good idea to always use an Actor interface for you classes. Performance difference?
 * May be a good idea to think more scala-akka. receive(CommandOrCallback) instead of many
   small methods.
 
 [Bugs and enhancements]
 * Transactions and nested public methods does not seem to work or I do not understand what to do...
   - Hmm, this works if I use transactional="true" on MatchActor but false on MatchRegistry when
     invoking createMatch on MatchRegistry.
 * Only exact methods (argument types) when using remote actors 
 * akka-spring: pre/post construction callbacks is missing
 * akka-spring: set dependencies does not work if method is not defined in interface. Has to be invoked
   on target instance, not on active object.
 * ActiveObject - Supervision does not work when using an interface. Will try to isolate this in smaller
   testcase.
 
 [Strange things]
 * Redis: Base64 is unreadable from the console with external tools! Really hard
   to see what i stored.
 
 [Questions]
 
 * How do I stop a Java actor and remove it from registry?
 * Hook into start method?
 * Redis, which persistence solution (map, vector, set). Missing remove or list/get methods?
 * Can I supply some logic into the supervisor which can do some extra stuff?
 * How do I use logging from java?
